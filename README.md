XAUUSD Market Structure Detection
A comprehensive system for detecting and marking market structure patterns (HH/HL/LL/LH/CHoCH/Internal-CHoCH) on XAUUSD (Gold) candlestick charts using strict, candle-based rules.

Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated market structure detection algorithm that identifies key price levels and trend changes in XAUUSD data across multiple timeframes (15m, 1H, 4H, Daily). The system uses strict candle-based rules without indicators or ATR, focusing on pure price action analysis.

Features
Phase 1 (Current) - Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
✅ CSV data loading with robust validation
✅ Timezone normalization (UTC)
✅ Duplicate removal and data cleaning
✅ OHLC data integrity validation
✅ Multi-timeframe resampling (15m → 1H, 4H, Daily)
✅ Comprehensive data quality reporting
✅ Docker containerization
✅ Full test coverage
Upcoming Phases
Phase 2: Core detection engine (HH/HL/LL/LH detection)
Phase 3: Interactive visualization with Streamlit
Phase 4: Gold-standard labeling and validation
Phase 5: CI/CD and comprehensive documentation
Phase 6: Live mode and deployment
Phase 7: Maintenance and multi-instrument support
Market Structure Rules
Trend Detection
HH (Higher High): Two consecutive red candles where second close < first low
LL (Lower Low): Two consecutive green candles where second close > first high
HL (Higher Low): Lowest point between confirmed HH and future candle closing above HH
LH (Lower High): Highest point between confirmed LL and future candle closing below LL
Change of Character (CHoCH)
Up → Down: After HL confirmation, two consecutive closes below HL (first must be red)
Down → Up: After LH confirmation, two consecutive closes above LH (first must be green)
Internal CHoCH
Up → Down Internal: Three confirmed LHs without new HL triggers internal CHoCH
Down → Up Internal: Three confirmed HLs without new LH triggers internal CHoCH
4H+ Engulfing Exception
Full-body engulfing candles can trigger confirmations on 4H+ timeframes
15m timeframe uses only two-candle patterns

Configuration
The system is configured via config.yaml:

yaml
data:
  timezone: "UTC"
  base_timeframe: "15min"
  resampled_timeframes: ["1H", "4H", "1D"]
  drop_duplicates: true
  validate_ohlc: true

rules:
  candle_color_rule:
    red: "close < open"
    green: "close > open"
    doji: "close == open"
  min_body_pct: 0.0

# ... (see config.yaml for full configuration)
